All your needs as a student just a click away.

Student life, often mentioned as the "seed time" of life is undoubtedly the most important time for any person to build their life. Success of a person depends on how well s/he utilizes the time. And without a doubt, student life is the best time for it. To make the life of a student a bit more easy, we made 'Focus', a simple yet useful app to help the student push their limit a bit more further.

This app is bundled with 8 different modules with their own use cases starting from a simple To Do list to a wikipedia integration. And everything is tied together with simple intuitive layout for an easy workflow.

## Installation


To run the scripts, then you must have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) properly installed in your machine. Then use these 5 simple commands to run the app.


1. `git clone https://github.com/PraneethGopinathan/Focus.git` # it clones the repository in your machine

2. `cd Focus` # Change your working directory

3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` # Install all the dependencies, might take time depending on your internet speed

4. `cd app` # Again change the directory

5. `python main.py` # Run the app


Now enjoy the app 😉.
